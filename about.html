		<h1> About myself </h1>

		<section>
		<h2>Who I am?</h2>
		I’m just a student. I love physics, music and computer science. I know, they are three things that are “a bit” different :=) But spending time on studying these topics I understand that they are correlated, and the more I study one of them, the more I love it!

		<section>
		<h2>What is my experience?</h2>
		I start my experience at 11 years old when I make my first live concert. At that time I play the bass guitar but my passion is and was the guitar! So day by day I grow up in life and music and at 14 years old I decide to took private lessons of guitar with Marco Soria (a special big hug to him, thanks Marco, you make me love and understand more music). I continue to play with some local band and we had great live experience, but three years ago (in 2015) it happens what i wish! Marco asked me if I want to play with him in his beautiful project, AMEMANERA. Meanwhile I continue develop skill in computer science and I learn different programming languages (as C, JAVA, SQL, VBA,..).

		<h2>Where I studied and where I am studying?</h2>
		I attended high school in Asti, at the Liceo Scientifico “F. Vercelli”. I choose the new couse that was called “Opzione scienze applicate” so I study computer science since 14 years old. During those years I learned to programming in different language: C, JAVA, SQL, VBA, OCTAVE/MATLAB, C++, HTML, Python, Arduino and LaTex. Now I’m attending to Politecnico di Torino in ECE (electronic and communications engineering). This undergraduate program is completely offer in English.

		<h2>Scholarship and reward</h2>
		For two consecutive years (this one and the last one) I took a reduction of the fee for merit and a scholarship for ECE student.
